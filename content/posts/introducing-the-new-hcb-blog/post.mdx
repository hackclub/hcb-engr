Today we're launching a new way to stay up-to-date on HCB: our new blog. And you're looking right at it!

For as long as I can remember, HCB has been using [Headway](https://headwayapp.co) to announce product updates and changes to users, but over time our needs have shifted. Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.

With this change, all of our posts are now open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb-engr) as well.

We're excited to share more with you in the future. Stay tuned!
