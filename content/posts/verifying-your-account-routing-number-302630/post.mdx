Are you trying to manually link your organization's **account & routing numbers** with a 3rd party service? Sometimes these services will ask for a bank account letter that proves you have access to your account number.

Luckily for you, sitting right on your documents page is a **verification letter** you can share. ✨✅

This handy one-pager allows organizations on HCB to prove they have access to their account & routing numbers.
