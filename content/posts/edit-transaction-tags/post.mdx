Is your organization's ledger cluttered with what seems like an endless cave of transactions? Travel, food, supplies, and subscriptions are all together in one list. *If only there was a way to group transactions together...*

A few years ago, we launched transaction tags to solve this problem. If you enable the feature preview in your organization's settings, you'll be able to create tags and add as many as you wish to any transactions in your organization:

However, you always had to create and remove tags from a transaction, and you couldn't change a tag's name or color after it was created. There's now a new tab in your organization's settings page for tags, where you can create, update, and delete any tag! âœ¨
