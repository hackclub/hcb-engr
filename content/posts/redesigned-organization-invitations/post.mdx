HCB's mission is to provide an accessible financial toolkit for nonprofit projects, so we want to make it easy to invite collaborators. Previously, you needed to know every collaborator's email address to add them on HCB.

Starting today, it's easier than ever to add members to your organization: just share a link! The new layout combines email invites and our new invite links into a single modal.

With the new invite links, you can now share them with customizable expiration dates and revoke whenever you need to. We hope these changes make it easier to work together with your team on HCB. Let us know what you think!
