Fundraising for your nonprofit or hackathon is hard, and takes time away from actually using the donated money. What if the funds could raise themselves?

To fix this, I added a monthly subscription option to your organization's donation page— now when a donor sends a payment, they can opt-in to make their donation monthly. No more manually sending invoices every month.

> _Here's [my own org's](https://bank.hackclub.com/donations/start/crowded-utopia?monthly=true) monthly donation page!_

This feature is live for everyone right now— you don't need to opt-in. You can see your recurring donors in your dashboard's Donations tab:

Hope this helps you spend less time fundraising, and more time doing whatever it is your nonprofit does.
