In the dark days of HCB, inviting people to your organization was always a binary risk assessment - "do I give this person unfettered access to everything, or nothing at all?"

Once we realized this was Suboptimal And A Bit Dangerous‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, we started to think about operational security from users' perspectives more carefully.

[User roles](https://hcb.hackclub.com/roles) was step one. This introduced predetermined permission sets to control users' access in an organization.

Today, **we're introducing spending controls**. This allows managers of HCB organizations to impose a finer level of control on how much money a member can spend.

<br/>

# Here is a rundown of how to use it:

To get to a team member's spending controls page, visit the Team page and click on the `$` icon next to their name.


import headway_fionahackworthusercardpng from "./headway_fionahackworthusercardpng_3ljgv8lh.png";
      
<Image src={headway_fionahackworthusercardpng} alt={"fiona-hackworth-user-card.png"} />


A team member's spending controls page gives you consolidated details of how they're using their cards.


import headway_fionahackworthspendingpng from "./headway_fionahackworthspendingpng_geox5b7n.png";
      
<Image src={headway_fionahackworthspendingpng} alt={"fiona-hackworth-spending.png"} />

When controls are disabled, a member can spend any amount of money with their cards. (Since they're not managers, so still can't transfer via ACH, check, HCB transfer, etc.)

### Now, let's enable spending controls for Fiona.

import headway_fionaspendingenabledpng from "./headway_fionaspendingenabledpng_205b7gpn.png";
      
<Image src={headway_fionaspendingenabledpng} alt={"fiona-spending-enabled.png"} />


With spending controls enabled, new transactions on Fiona's card will be approved/declined based on Fiona's balance. Since we haven't given her an allowance yet, her balance is zero! (as seen above)

### Let's give Fiona an allowance of $2,500!
_Hint: click the `New` button on the top right._


import headway_fionaspendingenabledwithcontrolpng from "./headway_fionaspendingenabledwithcontrolpng_n7rpjpz.png";
      
<Image src={headway_fionaspendingenabledwithcontrolpng} alt={"fiona-spending-enabled-withcontrol.png"} />

Now that I've given Fiona an allowance, she can spend it with her card! This $2,500 didn't leave the organization's balance when I created an allowance. Instead, both balances will decrease when she makes a purchase.

You should probably also know that these allowances are not time-dependent. They don't expire, and they do not recur (it's not a weekly/monthly limit).


As a convenience, you can also choose to enable spending controls and set an initial amount when you invite someone to your organization.
