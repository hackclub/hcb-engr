Hey folks - thanks for all great feedback on our recent reimbursements launch! 

We’ve now made the peer review stage of the reimbursements flow optional. That means that you can choose whether or not other team members have to review a report submitted by a team member.

This setting can be found under `Reimbursements` on your organization’s settings page.

Team reviews are still required for all reports submitted by external contributors.
