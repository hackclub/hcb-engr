From running an event to fighting world hunger, there's one thing that all organizations on HCB have in common: raising money!
It's easy to get caught up in running your nonprofit organization and helpful to take a step back to see the progress you've made each month.

In May, we sent out the first donation summary to all members of organizations that received at least one donation in April.
HCB will continue to send out these summaries on the first of each month. We hope this summary will help you to better see your progress towards the goals of your organizations!
