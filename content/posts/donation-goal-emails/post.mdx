Earlier this year, we launched [donation goals](/posts/donation-goals) to help you set clear targets for your fundraising efforts.
Now, you'll also get email updates on your progress towards your donation goals, in addition to being able to see your progress on your donations page.

If you have donation goals enabled, which you can configure in your organization settings, your monthly donation summaries will include your progress towards your donation goals.

Your team will also now get an email once you hit your donation goal!
