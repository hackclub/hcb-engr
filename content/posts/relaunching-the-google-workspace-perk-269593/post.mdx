Hi HCB users! Has it been your lifelong dream to use Google Workspace? :cloud: Have you ever wanted to make your emails even more awesome with the flair of a custom domain? Well, now you can - we're relaunching the Google Workspace perk! :tada:

Head on over to your org on Bank, and you'll find that there's now a Google Workspace tab in the sidebar where you can join the waitlist!

![Google Workspace Waitlist Page](https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/111/240-ad5f23acd2033b3b86753eaad9419cb1ff597ec1.png)

![Google Workspace Waitlist Form](https://cloud.headwayapp.co/changelogs_images/images/big/000/111/241-7f71a5e97580a881539ed8753d968741afe70110.png)

Once you've filled out the form, we'll get back to you within the next 48 hours to let you know if you're approved for one of our open slots.

Unfortunately, we still only have a set limit of slots for access from Google to distribute, but we have systems in place now that will open these up more frequently.

:moneybag: P.S. Orgs with donor funding will be prioritized for open slots.
