Money’s great. If you’re reading this, you probably like money. Now, we’re making it easier than ever to get it.

**Starting today, you can now process reimbursements for yourself, your team members, and your volunteers through HCB directly.**

Looking to be reimbursed? Here's the process:

1. Compile a collection of expenses into a report on HCB.

2. Have your report reviewed by a team member and a HCB admin.

3. Get paid through ACH transfer or check.

You can try it out today in “Reimbursements” tab of your project.

_Been using Expensify? We'll continue to process open reports; however, future reports should be made on HCB. We'll reach out soon with more details about offboarding from Expensify._
