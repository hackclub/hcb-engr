Right now, HCB's login page is a little boring. It gets the job done, but it's by no means exciting. That's why we're thrilled to unveil our refreshed login experience!

It features a sleek, intuitive design and now includes a gallery of handpicked images from iconic organizations running on HCB. Plus, it provides some insight into what HCB is all about.

We're hoping the new design improves your experience on HCB and we're always happy to hear feedback.
