A couple of exciting updates to donations have shipped in the past month. Here's a quick rundown:

* Donors can now leave a message when they make a donation (this message will be emailed to you!)

* In your organization's settings page, you can set a `reply-to` email for the receipts that donors receive.

* You can send a message to your donor by replying to the donation notification email that HCB sends you!
