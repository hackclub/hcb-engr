Behind the scenes, we've got a team of auditors and accountants making sure HCB keeps running. It's tax season and they're busy at work.

To make auditing more streamlined, we're going to be collecting receipts for all ACH transfers and outbound checks.

**Receipts will be required for ACHs & checks sent after February 2024.**

Want to get a head start? The field for receipts is already there:

Have fun! And thanks for helping us keep HCB compliant with IRS requirements.
