A feature preview is live for users to try out: **transfers between HCB accounts**.

People who are on multiple teams (ie. running a hackathon and running a club with separate accounts) can manage their money across accounts on Hack Club Bank.

Previously users would have to invoice themselves to move funds. Besides the 7% fee on those funds, it would take between 5-7 days for funds to show up. **Transfers cut the time in half and changes "fee" to "free".**

You can enable the beta [in your account settings](https://bank.hackclub.com/my/settings#feature-previews). Please send me your feedback!
