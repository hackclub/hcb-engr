Inviting people to your organization should be simple. Until now, our flow for adding teammates relied solely on email-based invitations, which worked—but didn’t cover every use case. Robotics teams wanted a way to distribute a link in Discord. Hackathon organizers needed a way to quickly invite their entire team.
Today, we’re shipping a redesigned invite UI that solves those problems with a cleaner experience, a modernized interface, and a brand-new feature: invite links.

The first thing you’ll notice in the new modal is clarity.
The updated layout combines email invites and link-based invites into a single, unified interface. The top focuses on the required attributes for an invite—email, role, and (optionally) spending controls. The redesigned “Send” button is now easier to use with the email field directly accessible to its left.

With the new invite links, you can now share them with customizable expiration dates and revoke whenever you need to! This makes inviting your whole team easier than ever before.
