All ACH transfers sent from HCB are now processed [same-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACH_Network#Same-day_ACH)!

That means, the moment an ACH is approved by HCB, it’ll arrive that day ([view the timing specifics](https://column.com/docs/ach/timing#same-day-timing)). In most cases, this should cut the waiting time for an ACH from three business days to one.
