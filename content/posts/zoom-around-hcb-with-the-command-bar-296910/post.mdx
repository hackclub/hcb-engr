Need to get somewhere quickly in HCB? Try hitting `Ctrl` / `âŒ˜` + `k` to pull up the command bar:


import headway_Screenshot20240715at113716AMpng from "./headway_Screenshot20240715at113716AMpng_kqvq9ewn.png";
      
<Image src={headway_Screenshot20240715at113716AMpng} alt={"Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 11.37.16â€¯AM.png"} />


From there you can navigate to all of your organizations or search HCB for a specific transaction, card, or reimbursement. Let us know what you think!
