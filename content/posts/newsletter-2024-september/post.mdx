I realized last time I didn't introduce myself! My name is Dylan, I'm the Product Manager here at HCB. This means in addition to directly supporting organizations on HCB, I get to work with our incredible engineering team to design new features.

Before joining HCB late last year, I was heavily involved in climate justice organizing at New York University. I helped start the Sunrise Movement chapter on campus and pushed the university administration to stop investing in the fossil fuel industry.

If you ever have feature requests or ideas on how to make HCB better, let me know!

### üí´ Sleek new footer & support button

* * * * *

We've put all the essential support links into a single support button at the bottom right of your screen. With just a click, you can contact us, leave feedback, or access our API docs and brand guidelines.

Also, be sure to visit our¬†Help Center¬†for tips, guides, and answers to FAQs---it's the best way to make the most of our features.

### ‚ú® AI-powered transaction memos

* * * * *

Transparency Mode has been one of HCB's flagship features for years. It revolutionized nonprofit financial transparency and allowed donors and the public to see how an organization utilizes funds. However, we've found that showcasing every transaction can sometimes mean extra housekeeping work for teams to keep the ledger tidy.

That's why we're excited to announce AI-powered memos for transactions!

Now, with 1-click, you can generate a transaction memo summarizing the receipt for any transaction. It's pretty simple:

1.  Upload a receipt to a transaction.

1.  Click the purple AI button to generate a memo.

1.  Accept the suggestions by clicking the checkmark or pressing¬†[enter].

You'll also notice that the receipt sidebar now includes some extracted information that provides a glanceable overview of the receipt's contents.

As usual, we want to hear what you think!

### üíù Simple, secure one-click donations

* * * * *

As your fiscal sponsor, our mission is to empower¬†*your mission*. This means helping you collect the donations that keep the lifeblood of your organization running.

As a result, we're introducing donations powered by¬†Link. Link autofills your donors' payment details so they can easily complete their donation.

These simple, secure one-click payments are helping organizations grow their funds.

In addition to Link, we support Apple Pay, Google Pay, and good old-fashioned cards! üí≥

### ‚ö° We've sped up ACH transfers from three days to one day

* * * * *

All ACH transfers sent from HCB are now processed¬†same-day!

That means, the moment an ACH is approved by HCB, it'll arrive that day (view the timing specifics). In most cases, this should cut the waiting time for an ACH from three business days to one.
