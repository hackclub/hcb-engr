Last year, HCB launched [wire transfers](/posts/wires), a built-in way to send money internationally from HCB. Today, we're excited to announce a new international payment method: **Wise**.

## What is Wise?

Wise is a payment processor that allows you to send money in USD and receive money in over 40 currencies. They offer transparent exchange rates and no minimums. This makes Wise a great option for small-value international payments. You can learn more about Wise on their [website](https://wise.com/).

## Reimbursing via Wise

You can now also add Wise as a reimbursement payout method! Head over to your [payout settings](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/settings/payouts) on HCB to add Wise as a payout method.

## Fees with Wise

Unfortunately, Wise transfers are not free to sendâ€”Wise charges a variable rate fee on every transfer. HCB will never charge you fees to send a transfer or reimbursement.

However, to help ensure transparency, you can see just how much each transfer or reimbursement will cost you to send.

We're so happy that Wise is finally available on HCBâ€”we know it'll make sending money easier for many of our international users. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us at [hcb@hackclub.com](mailto:hcb@hackclub.com).
