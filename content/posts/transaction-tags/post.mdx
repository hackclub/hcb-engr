Is your organization's ledger cluttered with what seems like an endless cave of transactions? Travel, food, supplies, and subscriptions are all together in one list. *If only there was a way to group transactions together...*

A few years ago, we launched transaction tags as a feature preview to solve this problem. Now, we're officially launching transaction tags for everyone! You'll be able to create tags and add as many as you wish to any transactions in your organization.

We've also made some new improvements to tags if you've been using the feature preview:
- ü§™ Tags now have emojis! Existing tags have been automatically matched with an emoji, using AI

- ‚öôÔ∏è There's also now a tab in your organization's settings page where you can create, update, rename, and delete any tag

Hopefully this will help you clean up your ledger - happy HCBing!
