Looking for a way to make sure you can never get locked out of HCB? You can now generate 10 backup codes for your account:

import screenie from "./screenie.png";
      
<Image src={screenie} alt={"A photo showing the backup codes section in user security settings, reading \"You last generated a set of 10 backup codes on July 22, 2025, of which 10 are still valid. If you'd like to regenerate your backup codes, click the button above to do so. Generating a new set of codes will invalidate your current codes.\""} />

Keep them safe and secure because backup codes can be used to replace any authentication method during the login process. If you have 2FA enabled, you'll still need another authentication factor in addition to your backup code.
