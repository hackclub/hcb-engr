Looking for a way to make sure you can never get locked out of HCB? You can now generate 10 backup codes for your account:

import screenie from "./screenie.png";
      
<Image src={screenie} alt={"A photo showing the backup codes section in user security settings with a newly set of generated backup codes to be saved."} />

Keep them safe and secure because backup codes can be used to replace any authentication method during the login process. If you have 2FA enabled, you'll still need another authentication factor in addition to your backup code.
