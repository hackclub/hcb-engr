Transparency Mode has been one of HCB’s flagship features for years. It revolutionized nonprofit financial transparency and allowed donors and the public to see how an organization utilizes funds. However, we’ve found that showcasing every transaction can sometimes mean extra housekeeping work for teams to keep the ledger tidy.

That’s why we’re excited to announce AI-powered memos for transactions!

Now, with 1-click, you can generate a transaction memo summarizing the receipt for any transaction. It’s pretty simple:

1. Upload a receipt to a transaction.
2. Click the purple AI button to generate a memo.
3. Accept the suggestions by clicking the checkmark or pressing <kbd>[enter]</kbd>.

You’ll also notice that the receipt sidebar now includes some extracted information that provides a glanceable overview of the receipt’s contents.
