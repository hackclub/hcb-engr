Which card is which? Is 6014 for this or that? Ugh. If you’re a member of multiple HCB organizations, it can be hard telling your cards apart. 

I’ve started writing the organization name on the back of mine:

We’ve got a more elegant solution for you all, however. You can now customise the logo printed in the top right and we’ve started printing the organization name on the card:

Plus, we’ve got white cards now. Fancy.
