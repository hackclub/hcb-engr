HCB's donation page is a great way to raise money for your organization. With one click, you can share a link to your donation page on social media, in emails, or on your website. It's incredibly versatile, but how do you know which platforms work?

Starting today, you can track which website referred your donors, and, for more granular insights, the [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) of the link they clicked. This data is available on the transaction details page for all donations with referrer data.

Hopefully this feature will help you understand where your donors are coming from and how to better reach them in the future!
