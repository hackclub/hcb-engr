Exciting news for organizations doing work outside the US! HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:

To send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.

Unfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.
