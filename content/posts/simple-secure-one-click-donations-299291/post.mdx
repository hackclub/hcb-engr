As your fiscal sponsor, our mission is to empower _your mission_. This means helping you collect the donations that keep the lifeblood of your organization running.

As a result, we're introducing donations powered by [Link](https://link.com/). Link autofills your donors' payment details so they can easily complete their donation.

These simple, secure one-click payments are helping organizations grow their funds.
