📝Introducing the HCB Blog!
---------------------------

Today we're launching a new way to stay up-to-date on HCB: our new blog.

For as long as I can remember, HCB has been using Headway to announce product updates and changes to users, but over time our needs have shifted. Along with changelog updates, we want to share more content online, like engineering deep-dives, our monthly newsletters, and more.

With this change, all of our posts are now open source and available on GitHub as well.

We're excited to share more with you in the future. Stay tuned!

### 🍎 Fresh & crisp Apple Wallet card design

* * * * *

For a long time, HCB cards appeared as a mysterious, dark, unbranded card in your Apple Wallet.

Today, we're excited to announce that it's getting a new look! Some people might say it's fresh & crisp, just like a juicy apple 🍎. Enjoy!

Thanks to Ian and Sam for the design work!

### 🌏 International bank transfers are here

* * * * *

Exciting news for organizations doing work outside the US! HCB now supports sending money to overseas bank accounts via an international wire:

import internationalBankTransfers from "./internationalBankTransfers.png";

<Image src={internationalBankTransfers} />


To send an international wire, you'll need your recipient's bank's SWIFT code and account number as well as some country-specific information. Once you've got that, it's just like sending an ACH transfer to a US bank account on HCB.

Unfortunately, wires are expensive to send. Our partner bank charges us $25 per wire; therefore, to keep HCB sustainable without passing this fee onto you, each wire sent must be at least $500. We've waived this requirement for organizations that have raised over $50k.

If you have any feedback on this wires feature, we'd love to hear from you! We're always looking to improve our product, and wires has been a difficult feature to polish.

* * * * *

When we need help from you, we want to make sure we're reaching out to the right people.

By default, we'll email everyone who is a part of your team on HCB. However, if you have a shared team email or would prefer for us to reach out to a specific email, you can now let us know.
