If you're anything like me, the number in the little red dot next to your receipts tab gets a little too high sometimes, which presents a problem:
how do I make that number lower so our bookkeeper isn't sad at month-end close while still putting in a minimum of effort because I'm lazy?

Receipt Bin is a game-changer for this – if you're not familiar with it yet please [go read about it](/posts/receipt-bin-280777), I'll wait...
(the pitch: throw all your receipts in here and then worry about attaching them to transactions later!)

My one gripe with it is that bringing in a whole inbox-ful of automatically generated receipts was always a task-and-a-half due to having to forward them one.. by one... by one..... as in the following dramatic reenactment:

import old_way from "./old_way.gif";
import the_new_hotness from "./the_new_hotness.gif";

<Image src={old_way} alt={"gmail opening a bunch of forward windows that need to be individually dealt with"} />

No more! This annoyed me enough that I fixed it:

Now, any `.eml` attachments sent to your Receipt Bin inbox will be converted to PDF receipts the same way individual emails are.

In Gmail you can do this by selecting multiple emails, right-clicking, and clicking "Forward as attachment".

<Image src={the_new_hotness} alt={"forwarding multiple emails as .eml attachments in gmail"} />

Most of the time they're even automatically matched to transactions!
This means I can spend less of my time shuffling receipts around and more time <strike>spending money</strike>doing things that actually benefit Hack Clubbers.

I hope this speeds up your day too! Thanks for reading and happy HCBing :-D
