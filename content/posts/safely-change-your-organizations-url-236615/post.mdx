Have you ever wanted to change your organization's URL? Previously this was a dangerous affair; bookmarks to the old URL would just stop working, including your donation page.

Now, we'll **automatically redirect your old URL to your new one**! It's like magic.

You can change your organization's URL by clicking "Settings" in the sidebar. Happy hacking!
