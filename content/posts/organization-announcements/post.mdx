Organizations on HCB do so much and raise a ton of money through donations! Yet, donors and other people interested in your mission are often left out of the loop.

We've launched Organization Announcements to help you send out announcements to people who want to stay up to date with your organization! This includes donors and anyone else who wants to follow you.

You'll now be able to:
- 👥 Have people follow your organization with the Follow button on your Transactions and Announcements pages
- 📣 Send out announcements using a rich-text editor and blocks that include data from HCB
- 🗒️ See announcements from organizations that you follow in your email and on the new Feed page

If your organization is not in Transparency Mode, you can still post announcements and get followers by sharing a link to your announcements page. Your announcements page will not be publicly accessible until you publish your first announcement.

Want to try it out? HCB has already published their first announcement, so go follow them at [hcb.hackclub.com/bank/announcements](https://hcb.hackclub.com/bank/announcements)!
