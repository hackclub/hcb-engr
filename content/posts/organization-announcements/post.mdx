Organizations on HCB do so much and raise a ton of money through donations! Yet, donors and other people interested in your mission are often left out of the loop.

We've launched <b>Organization Announcements</b> to help you send out announcements to people who want to stay up to date with your organization! This includes donors and anyone else who wants to follow you.

You'll now be able to:
- 👥 Have people follow your organization with the Follow button located on your Transactions and Announcements pages
- 📣 Send out announcements using a rich-text editor and blocks that include data from HCB
- 🗒️ See announcements on the new [Feed](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/feed) page, and receive them in your email inbox.

Announcements are automatically enabled for transparent organizations. If your organization is not in [Transparency Mode](https://blog.hcb.hackclub.com/posts/transparent-finances-optional-feature-151427), you can still post announcements and get followers by sharing a link to your announcements page. For non-transparent organizations, your announcements page will not be publicly accessible until you publish your first announcement.

Want to try it out? HCB has already published their first announcement, so go follow us at [hcb.hackclub.com/bank/announcements](https://hcb.hackclub.com/bank/announcements)!
