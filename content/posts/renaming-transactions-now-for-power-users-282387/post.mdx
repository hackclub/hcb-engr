[Preview]

We at Hack Club HQ love to fill our HCB account's ledger with emojis and custom memos for each transaction. Recently, however, we've been falling behind due to the volume of transactions on the account.

Today, we've added a new feature preview (["Rename Transactions on the Ledger"](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/settings/previews#rename_on_homepage)) that'll make renaming transactions a lot faster. After enabling it, head to your organization's homepage and double click on any transaction's memo. A text box will appear and you'll be able to add a custom memo right there on the homepage. All you've got to do is click enter to save!
