Since [May 2022](https://changelog.hcb.hackclub.com/reply-with-your-receipt-232004), you've been able to respond to HCB's transaction notifications with a receipt. 

Starting today, you can rename the transaction in the same email. Simply type `@rename` and follow that with your memo for the transaction, for example:

```
@rename üçî Lunch with HCB users in Berkeley
```

HCB will handle the rest! Pretty sweet, huh?
