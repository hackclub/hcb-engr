If you've got donors feeling super generous, they can now check a box to cover the fees associated with their donations:


import headway_Screenshot20240626at112742AMpng from "./headway_Screenshot20240626at112742AMpng_jov4kznx.png";

That means more money for you! If you'd like this on your organization's donation form, enable it in the `Feature previews` settings section.
