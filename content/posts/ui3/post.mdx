})

**We've re-written our interface to make managing your organization's finances more intuitive than ever.**

- 🔍 Finding what you need is now simpler. We've reorganized menus, making them consistent on both mobile and desktop.
- 🎯 Less clutter, more focus. HCB now follows modern design principles, helping you get what you need faster.
- 💬 From transactions to transparency pages, we've made improvements across the platform based on real user feedback.

Don't worry – everything you rely on is still here. We've just made them easier to use and nicer to look at. This redesign was built with your experience in mind, and we're always looking to improve.
