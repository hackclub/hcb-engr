We've added two new ways to filter your transaction ledger! You can now quickly narrow down transactions by merchant or category, making it way easier to find exactly what you're looking for. 

Whether you're tracking down all your fundraising expenses or seeing everything you've spent at a specific vendor, these filters help you get there in just a couple clicks.
