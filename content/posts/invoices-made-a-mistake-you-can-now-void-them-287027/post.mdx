You can now void your invoices if you make a mistake in filling out a field, or if the invoice is no longer needed (like if it's overdue)!

![Picture of the invoice page showing a red button that says "Void this invoice"](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/ab34e4f46b065dac_image.png)

Just click the big red "Void this Invoice" button on an invoice and it'll be voided permanently.
