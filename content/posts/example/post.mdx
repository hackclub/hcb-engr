# Example post (this is a heading)

This is an example post! It outlines what a typical post looks like and how the HCB Blog is set up.

## Directory structure

You'll notice that all resources related to this post are enclosed in the `example` folder. This is because every post has its own folder. This makes it easier to manage resources like images, videos, and other files that are related to the post.

All posts are in the `/content/posts` directory. Inside of each post (for example, `/content/posts/example`), you'll find the `post.mdx` file. This file contains both the post content and the post metadata (like the title, author, and date).
