Starting today, in addition to a CSV or JSON file, you can now export your transaction into a Ledger file for use with the [Ledger CLI](https://ledger-cli.org/).

You may be wondering, what's the backstory behind Ledger? Five years ago, Hack Club HQ used Ledger to keep track of and open source all it's finances: [https://github.com/hackclub/ledger](https://github.com/hackclub/ledger). It became too much to maintain. When HQ itself began using HCB, we built Transparency Mode so that we could continue open sourcing our finances. That said, Ledger still is awesome. So now, if you'd like to use the Ledger CLI and are on HCB, you can export your transactions to the `.ledger` file format and have fun exploring your money in the terminal!

Additionally, you can also export the transactions of organisations with Transparency Mode enabled, check out HQ's finances: [https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger](https://hcb.hackclub.com/exports/hq.ledger).
