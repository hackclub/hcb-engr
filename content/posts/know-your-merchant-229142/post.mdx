We've just rolled out a set of changes around card charges to give a better understanding of where a transaction came from.

1. Now you can access more details about where you're making purchases from. You can click on the name of the seller/merchant for a transaction to get a list of details, such as their location, type of store, and contact info (when provided).
2. You can be sure your transactions are secure by viewing the payment type, location, and verification checks that ran when you spent your money. If a transaction is declined, you can tell if you mistyped your address or missed the expiration date.
