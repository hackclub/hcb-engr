I hate passwords. I can never [remember them when I need them](https://xkcd.com/936/), each new account I create means another ['unique' password](https://xkcd.com/792/), and [people are great at leaking them](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hunter2). We _really_ don't want to burden everyone with all that just to access their financial platform, so now it's even easier to login to Hack Club Bank without a password.

I'm happy to announce that **you can now get login codes for Hack Club Bank via SMS.** The feature can be enabled from [your settings page](https://bank.hackclub.com/my/settings).

_Users on iPhone and some Android phones can autofill their SMS login code._

You can now get your passwordless login code that much faster– reducing login on some devices down to under 10 seconds.
