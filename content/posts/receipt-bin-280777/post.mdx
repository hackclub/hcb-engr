The holidays are coming up and we know many of you are trying to keep yourselves off the accountantsâ€™ naughty list. And that means uploading receipts! To aid you in your recordkeeping endeavors, weâ€™re launching a brand new feature: Receipt Bin.

Receipt Bin allows you to upload your receipts now and worry about them later. Rather than scrambling to upload the receipt to the right transaction, you can just text it or email it to us. Weâ€™ll hang onto them for you and will try to suggest which transaction they belong to. You can then swing by the new-and-improved Receipt Center at any time to link the receipts from your Receipt Bin to their corresponding transaction.

Text [(864) 548-HACK](tel:864-548-HACK) or head to [the settings pageâ€¬](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/settings/previews#receipt-bin) to get started today!
