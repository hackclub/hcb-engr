A few months ago, we [launched organization announcements](/posts/organization-announcements) to help you keep your followers in the loop about your organization whenever you have an update.

Now, you can also enable monthly announcements in your organization settings to let HCB automatically generate a new announcement each month.
By default, they will include summarized data about your organization from the past month, such as donations and spending analyses, but you can edit the announcement to include whatever you'd like.

With monthly announcements, HCB will help you build your community by keeping fans and donors informed, while you focus on making your organization awesome! âœ¨
