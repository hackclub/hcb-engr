As of today you can test out a new preview feature: **SMS notifications when you swipe your card.**

Emails aren't always immediate, and when you're dashing through the checkout line at Costco while stocking up on breakfast for your hackathon 2 minutes could be the difference between remembering to take a photo of your receipt or  throwing it away entirely.

Now with SMS notifications, you'll get this:

When you use your card in-person, you'll get a text with a link to upload your receipt. You can opt-in to the feature preview from your [feature previews](https://bank.hackclub.com/my/settings/previews) page.

In the future we can add the ability to reply directly to the text with a photo of your receipt.
