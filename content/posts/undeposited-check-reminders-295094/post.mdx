Have you ever received a check in the mail and forgot to deposit it? ~~I sure have.~~

Now, weâ€™ll remind you if you havenâ€™t deposited an HCB check after a month, and again when you're nearing the end of the validity period (as long as the sender opted to notify the recipient).

Talking of, go and deposit that check sitting on your desk!
