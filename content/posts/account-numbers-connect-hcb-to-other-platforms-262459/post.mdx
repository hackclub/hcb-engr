This just in: Hack Club Bank accounts now have account/routing numbers, which means you can receive payouts from platforms like Shopify and Venmo!

Here are some cool things you can do with account numbers:

- Get sponsorships through GitHub Sponsors
- Start a swag shop with Shopify
- Get paid by sponsors _without going through the Bank team_
- Make a sandwich (untested)

You can receive money from any platform that asks for an account/routing number. For security, your account number is deposit-only: you can't withdraw money using it.

This is live for everyone right nowâ€” check out the new "Account/routing number" page in your sidebar and start receiving money!
