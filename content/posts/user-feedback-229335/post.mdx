Hey everyone! (*ðŸŽºðŸŽº noises*) Iâ€™m announcing my first ever feature contribution to Hack Club Bank. ðŸŽ‰ On your homepage, after logging in, you can now use the section called **"Feedback"** to ... well I think you can guess ... submit any ideas you have for cool new features on Bank! As always, you can still continue to reach out to us on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) or by [email](mailto:bank@hackclub.com).
