At HCB, we love security! You already could view active login sessions on your [User Security Settings](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/settings/security) page. We're now expanding it to include recently logged-out sessions just in case you're curious about when you last logged in/out of HCB!

This is just one of the many improvements to account security weâ€™re making to HCB. More to come!
