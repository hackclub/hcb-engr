In 2023, [we introduced Receipt Bin](/posts/receipt-bin-280777), a new way to manage your receipts on HCB. Today, we're excited to announce that Receipt Bin is now generally available to all users!

We know many of our power users struggle to keep track of their receipts, especially while in a rush or traveling. Receipt Bin allows you to upload your receipts to HCB and worry about linking them to transactions later. Rather than scrambling to upload the receipt to the right transaction, you can just text it or email it to us. Weâ€™ll hang onto them for you and will try to suggest which transaction they belong to.

Along the way, we've added some additional improvements to Receipt Bin. Here are a few:

- **ðŸ“§ [Multi-email forwarding](/posts/forward-multiple-emails)**: HCB now handles forwarding multiple receipts at once from your email inbox to Receipt Bin.

- **âœ¨ [AI-powered transaction memos](/posts/ai-powered-transaction-memos-298733)**: When you upload or link a receipt on HCB, we'll suggest a transaction memo along with some additional information about the transaction.

- **ðŸ’¬ [Text your receipts to Receipt Bin](posts/text-us-your-receipts-295185)**: In addition to uploading online or by email, you can now text your receipts to HCB. If you have SMS transaction notifications turned on, just reply with a picture of your receipt.

- **ðŸ’° Reimburse from Receipt Bin**: Our [reimbursements feature](/posts/reimbursements-289630) that we launched last year now supports pulling receipts from Receipt Bin.

- **ðŸ§¾ Automatic receipt pairing**: HCB will now use AI to suggest which transaction a receipt belongs to. This will save you time and make it easier to keep your records up to date.

We hope these improvements make it easier for you to manage your receipts on HCB. [Give it a try today](https://hcb.hackclub.com/my/inbox)!
