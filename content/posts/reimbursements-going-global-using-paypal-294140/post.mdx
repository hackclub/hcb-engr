Hey folks! You may have noticed that we recently revamped our PayPal form; PayPal is now fully integrated into HCB. Thanks to this we can now send reimbursements through PayPal, including to contributors outside of the United States.

If you need to send a reimbursement to a person outside of the USA, have them select "PayPal" as their preferred payout method.
