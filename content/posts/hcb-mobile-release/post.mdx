We're incredibly excited to announce **HCB Mobile**, our official mobile app for iOS and Android! After more than a year of development, we're bringing the power of HCB to your pocket, making it easier than ever to manage your HCB organization's finances on the go.

No matter where you are, HCB Mobile has you covered with the ability to track your organization's finances, manage cards, upload receipts, and collect in-person donations.

## Features

- 📈 **Track your organization's finances**: See your organization's balance and transactions at a glance.

- 💳 **Manage your cards**: Issue new cards, add them to Apple / Google Wallet, and freeze or cancel them directly from your phone!

- 🧾 **Upload receipts the easy way**—we all know receipt tracking is painful, so we built it directly into the app! Upload photos directly from your device, share them from other apps, or match existing receipts to transactions with a tap.

- 💰 **Accept Tap to Pay donations**—accept contactless payments directly on your mobile device. No extra hardware required.
