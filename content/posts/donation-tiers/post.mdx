Ever wanted to give your donors more structure without adding friction? We just shipped the first version of *Donation Tiers* - a simple way for orgs to offer preset giving levels like "\$5/month – Supporter" or "\$20/month – Champion."

It’s optional, totally customizable, and shows up right on your public donation page.

This lays the groundwork for future perks (👀 exclusive newsletters?) and makes giving feel more personal - which means more recurring support for the mission you care about.

Enable the feature preview in your org's settings and let us know what you think!
