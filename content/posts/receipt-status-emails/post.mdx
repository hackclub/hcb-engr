HCB has a few ways for you to upload receipts for your transactions: on the website, text messages, and email.
When going through your emails, it can be difficult to remember if you've already uploaded a receipt. 🤔

To help you out, we've added a small indicator to emails that automatically updates
with the status of your transaction. If you've already uploaded a receipt, you'll see a green indicator letting you know,
and if not, you'll see a red button that links directly to the receipt upload page!

We hope this helps you with uploading your receipts!
