Hey all! Today hackathon grants are live.

In case you missed it, we’re distributing $500 grants for IRL high school hackathons with the help of [_FIRST_](https://www.firstinspires.org).

**If you're planning to run your own, [check it out](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/grant).**

Additionally, we’re waiving the 7% fee for IRL high school hackathons until Dec 31st. That means any funds you raise between now and then are fee-free! You can check your fee status on your event’s settings page.


P.S. The first grant has [already gone out](https://bank.hackclub.com/lelandhacks#vgHA5b)!
