Our team is always looking for new ways to help you understand and manage your finances. We've heard from many school clubs and robotics teams that they spend a lot of time on Discord, so we thought: why not bring HCB to Discord?

Starting today, you can use the HCB Discord bot to check your balance, view recent transactions, and even get notified of organization activity right in your Discord server. You can also upload missing receipts and open reimbursement with convenient commands.

Here's how it works:

1. Invite the HCB bot to your Discord server at [hcb.gg/discord](https://hcb.gg/discord).

2. Set up the bot with your HCB organization using the `/setup` command.

3. Use commands like `/balance` and `/transactions` to interact with your HCB account and get notified of new activity.

We're hoping this new integration will make it easier organizers to stay on top of their finances while providing transparency to community members. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us at [hcb@hackclub.com](mailto:hcb@hackclub.com)â€”we're still adding features to the bot, and we'd love to hear your ideas.
