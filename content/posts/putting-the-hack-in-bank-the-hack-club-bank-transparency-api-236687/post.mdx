We're excited to share that Hack Club Bank now has an official public API.

The [Hack Club Bank API](https://bank.hackclub.com/docs/api/v3/) is a read-only, unauthenticated REST API which enables you to read public information from organizations with [Transparency Mode](https://changelog.bank.hackclub.com/transparent-finances-(optional-feature)-151427) enabled. This includes transaction history like checks, ACHs, invoices, transfers, donations, as well as organizations and their respective team members.

This API will pave the way for more applications like [Slack Club Bank](https://github.com/cjdenio/slack-club-bank), [HackPenn's financial visualization](https://hackpenn.com/finances), and your next amazing project. We can't wait to see what you ship!
