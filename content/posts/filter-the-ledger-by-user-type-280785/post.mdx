Trying to find that card charge for last year's Christmas cookies? Struggling to locate the check you used to pay your event venue? Worry no more, we've got you.

Now, you can filter the ledger by transaction type (eg. check or donation) or by the user who made the transaction: 


import headway_screenshot_20231110_at_70334___pmpng from "./headway_screenshot_20231110_at_70334___pmpng_3xf7so0p.png";
