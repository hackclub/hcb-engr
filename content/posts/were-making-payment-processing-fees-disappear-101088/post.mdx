Starting today, there's no longer a fee for accepting credit cards, bank transfers, or any other payment method.

You've invoiced Balsamiq for $500, they paid via credit card, but you only received $485.20. Where'd that $14.80 go? Welcome to the world of payment processing. (HC Bank uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/pricing))

Payment processing fees are annoying. Calculating them ahead of time is frustrating and the result is always _less_ money for your event, club, or project.

**Starting today, Hack Club Bank will make all your payment processing fees disappear.**

This means that regardless of whether a sponsor is paying via credit card, ACH, or wire, when you send an invoice for $500, you'll receive $500.

And we're taking it even further.

**I'm proud to share we're also reimbursing all previous payment processing fees, from all time, for everyone.**

Depending on the size of past invoices, you'll receive somewhere between $4.48 and $390.50 (actual numbers) granted to your HC Bank account this week.
