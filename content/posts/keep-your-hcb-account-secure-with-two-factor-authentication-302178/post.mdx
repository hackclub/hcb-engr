Looking for a little bit of extra security? You can now turn on two-factor authentication for your account:

<Image src={headway_Screenshot20241007at52517PMpng} alt={"Screenshot 2024-10-07 at 5.25.17â€¯PM.png"} />


That'll prompt you for two authentication factors each time you log in, whether it's a hardware security key, a login code sent to your email/phone, or a time-based one time password.
