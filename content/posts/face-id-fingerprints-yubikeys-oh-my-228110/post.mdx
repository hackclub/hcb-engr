Few things are as essential to the banking experience as photo IDs. You always gotta wait for the teller to get a real good look at you, and your ID, before making a transaction. (after all, you wouldn't want your near-identical evil twin stealing your hard-earned money)

The Hack Club Bank experience should feel as good or better than a physical IRL bank. Now, **you can sign in using just your face (or fingerprint)**, on supported devices & browsers.

Currently, this includes modern versions of [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webauthn/), [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/), and [Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/07/30/introducing-web-authentication-microsoft-edge/) (as well as [some](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/03/19/passwordless-web-authentication-support-via-windows-hello/) [versions](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/08/05/web-authentication-in-firefox-for-android/) of Firefox), but you can check for support on your current device [using this nifty website](https://webauthn.me/browser-support).

Have a Yubikey? Guess what: Bank supports hardware security keys too!

To get set up, head on down to the brand new [Security Keys](https://bank.hackclub.com/my/settings#security-keys) section of your Bank settings. You'll be enjoying faster sign-ins in no time!
