> _Note: You need to have access to the Google Workspace perk on HCB to use this feature_

Have you ever needed to have multiple emails for your organization (like help@, sponsor@, [your name]@)?

Previously, you would have had to create a new account for each address, but you no longer need to.

**On HCB, you can now create up to 30 aliases per Google Workspace account**; all emails to these aliases will be sent to your main account. No more having to flip through 10 different inboxes!
