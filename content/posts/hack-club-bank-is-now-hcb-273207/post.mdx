Hey folks! We've got two brand new bits of info to share with you all. First, Hack Club Bank is _growing_ â€” we just hit ðŸ’¸ $10,000,000 ðŸ’¸ in total transactions for fiscally sponsored organizations! Go you! (and this doesn't even include Hack Club's money!)

Second bit of news: the government has some rules about who canâ€” and cannotâ€” call themselves a bank. Now that we've grown a LOT, it's time to change the way we refer to ourselves. As of today, **we're shortening our name to HCB**.

To celebrate, here are 10 acronyms for HCB:
```
Hankering for Cold Beans
Highly Confused Butler
Howling Canine Brigade
Hungry for Coarse Brisket
Hateful Crowd Booing
Happy Camels on Bicycles
Hungry Cheese Bandit
Hearin' those Catchy Blues
Hopelessly Craving Bacon
Hilarious Circus Buffoonery
```

We can now be found at [hcb.hackclub.com](https://hcb.hackclub.com), [hackclub.com/hcb](https://hackclub.com/hcb), [hcb@hackclub.com](mailto:hcb@hackclub.com), and so on. Not to fret, though; all of your old links will redirect, and we can still be reached at our old email. 

We're still the same ol' fiscal sponsor you know and love, just with a few fewer letters. _New name, same great taste!_
