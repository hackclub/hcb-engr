If you've got donors feeling super generous, they can now check a box to cover the fees associated with their donations.

That means more money for you! If you'd like this on your organization's donation form, enable it in your Donation settings.

We'll now send you an email when you sign in to HCB from a new device.

Shrimple as that 🦐

This summer, 30 Hack Clubbers from 12 states and 9 countries designed their own circuit boards. Then they went on a 7 day hike through the California wilderness. Many had never backpacked before, most had not made a circuit board, and almost everyone was meeting for the first time in-person.
