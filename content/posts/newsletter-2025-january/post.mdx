### ‚úâÔ∏è Simplify your emails with Google Workspace aliases

Note:*¬†You need to have access to the Google Workspace perk on HCB to use this feature*

Have you ever needed to have multiple emails for your organization (like help@, sponsor@, [your name]@)?

Previously, you would have had to create a new account for each address, but you no longer need to.

On HCB, you can now create up to 30 aliases per Google Workspace account; all emails to an alias will be sent to its parent account's inbox. No more having to flip through 10 different inboxes!

### Customise your HCB cards!

Which card is which? Is 6014 for this or that? Ugh. If you're a member of multiple HCB organizations, it can be hard telling your cards apart.

I've started writing the organization name on the back of mine:

import cardWithWrittenOrgName from "./cardWithWrittenOrgName.png";

<Image src={cardWithWrittenOrgName} />

We've got a more elegant solution for you all, however. You can now customise the logo printed in the top right and we've started printing the organization name on the card:

import moreElegantSolution from "./moreElegantSolution.png";

<Image src={moreElegantSolution} />

*(**Apex**¬†is a high-altitude balloon-forcused hackathon running on HCB!)*

Plus, we've got white cards now. Fancy.

If you have feedback or feature requests, I'd love to hear them. Let me know your number one wish for HCB in 2025!

All the best,
