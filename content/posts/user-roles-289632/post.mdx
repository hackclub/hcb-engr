As your organization grows, so too does the number of people you invite to HCB. Today, we're handing you the keys to lock down critical actions to your most trusted team members.

**When managing your team on HCB, you now have the choice of assigning users one of two roles: `manager` or `member`.**

- **Managers** can do everything, just like everyone could before. This includes actions like editing your organization's settings, managing other users, and sending money (ACH, Check, HCB transfer, etc.).

- **Members** have limited permissions, but they can still spend money using their HCB card.

Our goal is to enhance security and provide you with the tools to grow your organization. Take it for a test drive by enabling the User Roles feature preview in your organization's settings. To learn more, see the [roles](https://hcb.hackclub.com/roles) page.

_This feature has been highly requested, and we want to get it right. If you have feedback, please file it in the box at the bottom right of HCB._
